<!-- Attribute Directives:

Attribute Directives are basically used to modify the behavior or appearance of the DOM element or the Component. In Angular, there are two in-built attribute directives available. They are as follows:

   1. NgStyle: This NgStyle Attribute Directive is basically used to modify the element appearance or behavior.
   2. NgClass: This NgClass Attribute Directive is basically used to change the class attribute of the element in the DOM or in the Component to which it has been attached. -->


   <!-- Attribute Directives: Attribute directives modify the behavior or appearance of an existing element or component. They are used to change the behavior of elements by adding, removing, or manipulating their attributes or classes. -->


   <!-- What is an attribute directive?

Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. Essentially, it is a class annotated with the Directive decorator where you specify what change you want to occur and what CSS event (if any) you want to trigger that change. ngClass, ngStyle, and ngModel are examples of attribute directives built-in to the Angular framework. -->
